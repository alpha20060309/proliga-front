# Duplicate Notifications in Firebase Messaging (2025-05-07 22:57:39)

_**User**_

@firebase.js Whenever @firebase-messaging-sw.js I send notifications by token I receiving two one from background which is expected & one that is not expected, I dont' know why am I receiving the second one there is no code that should send notifications that I have written @sw.ts  what might be the cause of this 

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you analyze this issue with duplicate notifications. I'll examine the code and explain what's happening.

First, let's understand where notifications are being handled in your codebase:

1. In `firebase-messaging-sw.js`, you have background message handling:
```javascript
messaging.onBackgroundMessage((payload) => {
  console.log("[firebase-messaging-sw.js] Received background message ", payload);
  const notificationTitle = "Background Message Title";
  const notificationOptions = {
    title: payload?.notification?.title,
    body: payload?.notification.body,
    icon: "/favicon.png",
  };
  self.registration.showNotification(notificationTitle, notificationOptions);
});
```

2. In `firebase.js`, you have foreground message handling:
```javascript
onMessage(messaging, (payload) => {
  console.log("message", payload);
  //   displayNotification(payload);
});
```

The issue is likely occurring because:

1. When you send a notification to a token, Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) automatically handles the notification display in two scenarios:
   - When the app is in the background (handled by `firebase-messaging-sw.js`)
   - When the app is in the foreground (handled by `firebase.js`)

2. The duplicate notification is happening because:
   - The background service worker (`firebase-messaging-sw.js`) is showing a notification
   - The foreground handler in `firebase.js` is also showing a notification through the `displayNotification` function

To fix this, you should:

1. Either handle notifications only in the background service worker
2. Or handle notifications only in the foreground
3. Or implement logic to prevent duplicate notifications

Here's how you can modify your code to prevent duplicate notifications:

```javascript
// In firebase.js
onMessage(messaging, (payload) => {
  console.log("message", payload);
  // Only show notification if the app is in foreground
  if (document.visibilityState === 'visible') {
    displayNotification(payload);
  }
});
```

And in your `firebase-messaging-sw.js`:
```javascript
messaging.onBackgroundMessage((payload) => {
  console.log("[firebase-messaging-sw.js] Received background message ", payload);
  // Only show notification if the app is in background
  if (document.visibilityState === 'hidden') {
    const notificationTitle = payload?.notification?.title || "New Notification";
    const notificationOptions = {
      body: payload?.notification?.body || "You have a new notification",
      icon: "/favicon.png",
    };
    self.registration.showNotification(notificationTitle, notificationOptions);
  }
});
```

This way, you'll only show one notification based on whether the app is in the foreground or background. The visibility state check helps prevent duplicate notifications.

Also, make sure that when you're sending notifications, you're not accidentally sending the same notification twice through different channels or methods. Check your notification sending code to ensure you're not making duplicate API calls.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have questions about implementing these changes!

No I don't need to show any notifications if the app is active 

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I understand now. You only want to show notifications when the app is in the background, and not when it's active. Let's modify the code to achieve this.

1. First, let's modify the foreground message handler in `firebase.js` to not show any notifications:

```javascript
// In firebase.js
onMessage(messaging, (payload) => {
  console.log("message", payload);
  // Remove or comment out the displayNotification call
  // We don't want to show notifications when app is active
});
```

2. Keep the background message handler in `firebase-messaging-sw.js` as is, since it's correctly handling background notifications:

```javascript
// In firebase-messaging-sw.js
messaging.onBackgroundMessage((payload) => {
  console.log("[firebase-messaging-sw.js] Received background message ", payload);
  const notificationTitle = payload?.notification?.title || "New Notification";
  const notificationOptions = {
    body: payload?.notification?.body || "You have a new notification",
    icon: "/favicon.png",
  };
  self.registration.showNotification(notificationTitle, notificationOptions);
});
```

This way:
- When the app is active (foreground), you'll only log the message but won't show any notification
- When the app is in the background, the service worker will handle showing the notification

This should resolve the duplicate notification issue since we're now only showing notifications when the app is in the background. Let me know if you need any clarification!

Everything with displaying is fine it is just that I'm getting extra notification & there is no code that does that

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you investigate this issue. The extra notification you're receiving might be coming from Firebase's default behavior. Let's check a few things:

1. First, let's look at how you're sending the notification. When you send a notification to a token, Firebase has two ways to handle it:
   - Through the `notification` payload
   - Through the `data` payload

The key difference is:
- If you send a message with a `notification` payload, Firebase will automatically display it
- If you send a message with only a `data` payload, you have full control over how to display it

Let's check your notification sending code. Could you show me the code where you're calling `sendPushNotification` or any other method that sends notifications? This would help identify if the issue is coming from how the notification is being sent.

In the meantime, here's what you can try:

1. When sending notifications, use only the `data` payload instead of the `notification` payload. This gives you full control over notification display:

```javascript
// Instead of sending like this:
sendPushNotification(token, "Title", "Body", { someData: "value" });

// Send it like this:
sendPushNotification(token, null, null, {
  title: "Title",
  body: "Body",
  someData: "value"
});
```

2. Then modify your background message handler to only show notifications when explicitly requested:

```javascript
// In firebase-messaging-sw.js
messaging.onBackgroundMessage((payload) => {
  console.log("[firebase-messaging-sw.js] Received background message ", payload);
  
  // Only show notification if it's from our data payload
  if (payload.data && payload.data.title) {
    const notificationTitle = payload.data.title;
    const notificationOptions = {
      body: payload.data.body,
      icon: "/favicon.png",
    };
    self.registration.showNotification(notificationTitle, notificationOptions);
  }
});
```

Could you share:
1. The code where you're sending the notifications?
2. The exact payload structure you're sending?

This would help me identify exactly where the extra notification is coming from and provide a more specific solution.

I'm sending from FCM Client from firebase console using tokens

_**Assistant**_

Ah, now I understand the issue! When you send notifications from the Firebase Console, it automatically adds a `notification` payload to the message, which causes Firebase to display the notification automatically.

To prevent this double notification, you have two options:

1. **Option 1**: Send the message as a "Data message" instead of a "Notification message" in the Firebase Console:
   - When sending from Firebase Console, choose "Data message" instead of "Notification message"
   - This way, you'll have full control over when and how to display the notification

2. **Option 2**: If you need to keep using "Notification message" in the Firebase Console, modify your `firebase-messaging-sw.js` to check if the notification is already being handled:

```javascript
// In firebase-messaging-sw.js
messaging.onBackgroundMessage((payload) => {
  console.log("[firebase-messaging-sw.js] Received background message ", payload);
  
  // Only show notification if it's not already being handled by Firebase
  if (!payload.notification) {
    const notificationTitle = payload?.data?.title || "New Notification";
    const notificationOptions = {
      body: payload?.data?.body || "You have a new notification",
      icon: "/favicon.png",
    };
    self.registration.showNotification(notificationTitle, notificationOptions);
  }
});
```

I recommend using Option 1 (sending as a "Data message") because:
1. It gives you more control over the notification display
2. It prevents the automatic notification display from Firebase
3. It's more consistent with your current implementation

When sending from the Firebase Console:
1. Click "Send your first message"
2. Choose "Data message" instead of "Notification message"
3. Add your notification data in the data fields like:
   ```
   title: "Your Title"
   body: "Your Message"
   ```

This should resolve the duplicate notification issue while maintaining your desired notification behavior.

How to do option 1 exactly?

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll guide you through the exact steps to send a "Data message" from the Firebase Console:

1. Go to Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Engage" or "Messaging"
4. Click "Send your first message" or "Create campaign"
5. In the message type selection, choose "Data message" (not "Notification message")
6. Fill in the following fields:
   ```
   Key: title
   Value: Your notification title

   Key: body
   Value: Your notification message
   ```
7. Add any additional data you need:
   ```
   Key: url (optional)
   Value: /your-path

   Key: anyOtherData (optional)
   Value: anyValue
   ```
8. In the "Target" section, select "Single device" and paste your FCM token
9. Click "Send message"

The message structure will look like this in your code:
```javascript
{
  data: {
    title: "Your notification title",
    body: "Your notification message",
    url: "/your-path",
    anyOtherData: "anyValue"
  }
}
```

This way, Firebase won't automatically display the notification, and your service worker will handle it according to your code in `firebase-messaging-sw.js`.

Remember: The key difference is that you're sending the message as a "Data message" instead of a "Notification message", which prevents Firebase from automatically displaying the notification and lets your service worker handle it exclusively.

I can't find message type section

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me provide more specific steps with the current Firebase Console interface:

1. Go to Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Engage" or "Messaging"
4. Click "Create campaign"
5. Select "Firebase Notification messages"
6. Click "Next"
7. In the "Notification" section:
   - Leave the "Notification title" and "Notification text" fields empty
   - Click on "Additional options" or "Advanced options"
   - Look for "Data" or "Custom data" section
   - Add your data there:
     ```
     Key: title
     Value: Your notification title

     Key: body
     Value: Your notification message
     ```
8. In the "Target" section, select "Single device" and paste your FCM token
9. Click "Send message"

If you still can't find these options, could you share a screenshot of what you see in the Firebase Console? That would help me provide more accurate guidance based on your specific interface.
