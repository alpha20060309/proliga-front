Let me help you fix this `createSlot` error. This typically happens due to version mismatches with Radix UI components.

Let me check the package.json to see the Radix UI package versions:

---

Read file: package.json

Let me check the button component since it's using the Slot from Radix UI:

---

Read file: src/@/components/ui/button.jsx

Now I understand the issue. The error `(0 , _radix_ui_react_slot__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_3__.createSlot) is not a function` occurs because you're using an outdated import approach with a newer version of the Radix UI Slot component.

In version 1.1.0 of `@radix-ui/react-slot` (which is what you have installed according to your package.json), the API changed compared to earlier versions. The component should be accessed directly rather than using `createSlot`.

Here's how to fix it:

---

```diff
  import * as React from 'react'
- import { Slot } from '@radix-ui/react-slot'
+ import * as SlotPrimitive from '@radix-ui/react-slot'
  import { cva } from 'class-variance-authority'
  import { cn } from '../../lib/utils'
```

```diff
  const Button = React.forwardRef(
    ({ className, variant, size, asChild = false, ...props }, ref) => {
-     const Comp = asChild ? Slot : 'button'
+     const Comp = asChild ? SlotPrimitive.Slot : 'button'
      return (
        <Comp
```

---

The error was occurring because of an API change in Radix UI packages. In the newer version that you're using (v1.1.0 of `@radix-ui/react-slot`), the correct import pattern is to import the namespace and then access the Slot component from it.

I changed two things:
1. Updated the import from `import { Slot } from '@radix-ui/react-slot'` to `import * as SlotPrimitive from '@radix-ui/react-slot'`
2. Updated the component reference from `Slot` to `SlotPrimitive.Slot`

This change aligns with how Radix UI components are structured in their latest versions, where components are accessed through the namespace rather than being imported directly. The error was occurring because the code was trying to use `createSlot`, which doesn't exist in the current version.

Try restarting your application - this should resolve the error.
