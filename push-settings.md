# ðŸ”” Notification Toggle: Best Practices

## What Should the Notification Toggle Do?

### ðŸš« What **NOT** to Do
- **Do NOT** attempt to revoke browser notification permission programmatically.
- Browsers **do not allow** apps to revoke notification permission once granted.
- **Users** must manage notification permissions themselves via browser settings.

---

### âœ… What the Toggle **Should** Control

- **Control** whether your backend sends notifications to this user/device.
- **Subscribe/Unsubscribe** the userâ€™s FCM token to/from your `"global"` topic on your backend.
- **Optionally:** Delete the FCM token from your backend when notifications are toggled off.

## ðŸ”„ Best Practice Flow

### When User Turns **Notifications OFF**
- **Do NOT:** Attempt to revoke browser permission.
- **DO:**
  - Unsubscribe the userâ€™s FCM token from the `"global"` topic (on your backend or via FCM API).
  - *Optionally:* Delete the FCM token from your backend (to stop all notifications to this device).
  - *Optionally:* Call `deleteToken()` on the client (to fully remove the token from the device).

### When User Turns **Notifications ON**
- **DO:**
  - Ensure notification permission is granted (prompt if not).
  - Retrieve the FCM token (using `getToken()`).
  - Register the token with your backend and subscribe it to the `"global"` topic.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Is Best Practice

- **User Control:** The toggle manages your appâ€™s notification logic, not browser permissions.
- **Reversible:** Users can toggle notifications on/off without changing browser settings.
- **Granular:** Enables future support for per-topic or per-device notification preferences.
