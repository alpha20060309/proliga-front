// ðŸ”” Push Notification Token Management Tasklist

- [X] **Do NOT attempt to revoke browser notification permission programmatically**
  - Browsers do not allow apps to revoke notification permission once granted.
  - Users must manage notification permissions themselves via browser settings.

- [ ] **Notification Toggle Logic**
  - [ ] When user turns notifications **ON**:
    - [ ] Ensure notification permission is granted (prompt if not).
    - [ ] Retrieve the FCM token using `getToken()`.
    - [ ] Register the token with your backend and subscribe it to the `"global"` topic.
  - [ ] When user turns notifications **OFF**:
    - [ ] Unsubscribe the userâ€™s FCM token from the `"global"` topic (on your backend or via FCM API).
    - [ ] *Optionally:* Delete the FCM token from your backend.
    - [ ] *Optionally:* Call `deleteToken()` on the client to fully remove the token.

- [ ] **Token Synchronization Best Practices**
  - [ ] On app start, always retrieve and validate the current token.
  - [ ] If notification permission changes, immediately request a new token.
  - [ ] Periodically (or on relevant triggers), call `getToken()` again to detect token changes.
  - [ ] If the token is new or has changed, update your backend accordingly.
  - [ ] On logout or opt-out, call `deleteToken()` and remove the token from your backend.

- [ ] **Handle Token Errors Gracefully**
  - [ ] If you encounter errors (e.g., "Requested entity was not found"), request a new token and update your backend.

- [ ] **Clean Up Old Tokens**
  - [ ] Remove invalid or expired tokens from your backend to prevent sending notifications to dead endpoints.

- [ ] **Efficient Backend Sync**
  - [ ] Only send the token to your backend if it is new or has changed.

- [ ] **User Control**
  - [ ] Ensure the toggle manages your appâ€™s notification logic, not browser permissions.
  - [ ] Allow users to toggle notifications on/off without changing browser settings.

- [ ] **Prepare for Future Enhancements**
  - [ ] Design for per-topic or per-device notification preferences.
